The longer it is left, the more serious heatstroke can become. In some cases, heatstroke can be fatal.\n\nHeatstroke can be brought on by physical exertion in hot conditions, or simply by being in a hot environment\n\nTreating heatstroke centers around bringing body temperature down.\n\nHeatstroke can occur as a result of:\n\nExposure to a hot environment.\n\nIn a type of heatstroke, called nonexertional (classic) heatstroke, being in a hot environment leads to a rise in core body temperature. This type of heatstroke typically occurs after exposure to hot, humid weather, especially for prolonged periods. \n\nIt occurs most often in older adults and in people with chronic illness.\n\nStrenuous activity. Exertional heatstroke is caused by an increase in core body temperature brought on by intense physical activity in hot weather.\n\nAnyone exercising or working in hot weather can get exertional heatstroke, but it's most likely to occur if you're not used to high temperatures.", "treatments": "Prevention:\n\nHeatstroke is predictable and preventable. \n\nWearing excess clothing or clothing that fits tightly won't allow your body to cool properly.\n\nProtect against sunburn. Sunburn affects the body's ability to cool itself, so protect yourself outdoors with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. \n\nDrink plenty of fluids. Staying hydrated will help your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature..\n\nTreatments:\n\nThe underlying cause must be removed. Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion on a hot day may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased water consumption and resting in a cool place.\n\nHeat stroke that results from drug exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures. Antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have no role in the treatment of heatstroke because antipyretics interrupt the change in the hypothalamic set point caused by pyrogens; they are not expected to work on a healthy hypothalamus that has been overloaded, as in the case of heatstroke.\n\nIn this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop hepatic, hematologic, and renal complications because they may aggravate bleeding tendencies.\n\nWhen body temperature is significantly elevated, mechanical cooling methods are used to remove heat and to restore the body's ability to regulate its own temperatures.\n\nPassive cooling techniques, such as resting in a cool, shady area and removing clothing can be applied immediately. Active cooling methods, such as sponging the head, neck, and trunk with cool water, remove heat from the body and thereby speed the body's return to normal temperatures. Drinking water and turning a fan or dehumidifying air conditioning unit on the affected person may improve the effectiveness of the body's evaporative cooling mechanisms (sweating).", "matched": false}}

This helps to open up the airways. \n\nShort-acting bronchodilator inhalers are often referred to as rescue inhalers and are used to quickly relieve the cough, wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of breath caused by asthma\n\nLong-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled.\n\nTreatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth.

Minimize contact with people who have colds. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before your meals.\n\nManage your allergies.\n\nAvoid cigarette smoke and polluted air. Tobacco smoke and other pollutants can irritate and inflame your lungs and nasal passages.\n\nUse a humidifier. If the air in your home is dry, such as it is if you have forced-air heat, adding moisture to the air may help prevent sinusitis. Be sure the humidifier stays clean and free of mold with regular, thorough cleaning.\n\nTreatment:\n\nUsing a nasal decongestant spray, such as oxymetazoline, can help relieve sinus infection symptoms short-term.\n\nOther over-the-counter medicines that contain antihistamines and decongestants can help with sinus infections, particularly if you also suffer from allergies.\n\nMedications:\n\nSudafed\nZyrtec\nAllegra\nClaritin", "matched": false}}

Pain, swelling, and stiffness are the primary symptoms of arthritis. Any joint in the body may be affected by the disease, but it is particularly common in the knee.\n\nKnee arthritis can make it hard to do many everyday activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. It is a major cause of lost work time and a serious disability for many people.\n\nThe most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but there are more than 100 different forms. While arthritis is mainly an adult disease, some forms affect children.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for arthritis, there are many treatment options available to help manage pain and keep people staying active.", "treatments": "Arthritis treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving joint function. You may need to try several different treatments, or combinations of treatments, before you determine what works best for you.\n\nMedications\nThe medications used to treat arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis. Commonly used arthritis medications include:\n\nAnalgesics. These medications help reduce pain, but have no effect on inflammation.\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs reduce both pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Oral NSAIDs can cause stomach irritation, and some may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke.\n\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs slow or stop your immune system from attacking your joints.\n\nTherapy\nPhysical therapy can be helpful for some types of arthritis. Exercises can improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding joints. In some cases, splints or braces may be warranted.\n\nSurgery\n\nIf conservative measures don't help, your doctor may suggest surgery, such as:\n\nJoint repair. In some instances, joint surfaces can be smoothed or realigned to reduce pain and improve function. These types of procedures can often be performed arthroscopically \u00e2\u20ac\u201d through small incisions over the joint.\n\nJoint replacement. This procedure removes your damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one. Joints most commonly replaced are hips and knees.\n\nJoint fusion. This procedure is more often used for smaller joints, such as those in the wrist, ankle and fingers. It removes the ends of the two bones in the joint and then locks those ends together until they heal into one rigid unit.", "matched": false}}
